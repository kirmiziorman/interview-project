# User Guide

Users are able to create custom GitHub repositories by following these steps:

1. Create a new branch of this repository.
2. In this new branch, create a folder for the repository you wish to create in the ./config_files folder.
3. Create a file called repo_config.yml in this folder.
4. This file will be used to configure the created repository.  Adjust the values in this file accordingly.
5. Submit a pull request to merge your branch into main.  When this pull request has been approved, the repository will be created.
