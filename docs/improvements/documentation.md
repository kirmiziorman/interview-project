# Documentation
- Instead of having one big README file, I opt for hosting MKDocs documentation on GitHub pages.
- This is clearer for the the user to navigate and content is broken down into manageable segments.
- Able to share URLs pointing to relevant sections of documentation, rather than to the main page of the GitHub repo.
- Automatically updates upon merge into main branch which triggers a mkdocs build in a separate branch.
- I divide the documentation up according to use case: 1) user guide for users that simply wish to make use of the service without necessarily understanding the details of its implementation; 2) infrastructure for other contributors to the package/supporting aws components.

## If I had more time
- Use mkdocstrings to create class reference pages.
